b. (10) We like to implement the four outputs in problem 1.a with PAL(Programmable Array Logic) as shown below. Notice that each output is connected to 2-input OR gate. You cannot add new wires or gates. Just mark x's on the intersection points of wires which have to be connected. The spare OR gate can be used freely if it is necessary.
