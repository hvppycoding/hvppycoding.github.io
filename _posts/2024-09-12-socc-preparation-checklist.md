# Conference Preparation Checklist

## 1. Travel Documents
- **Passport**: Ensure that your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates.
- **Visa**: Confirm if a visa is required for your stay. Typically, no visa is needed for stays under 90 days for conference purposes (e.g., for South Korean citizens traveling to Germany).
- **Conference Invitation**: Have your conference registration or invitation ready for immigration purposes.

## 2. Flight and Accommodation
- **Flight Tickets**: Book your flight tickets early to get better prices.
- **Accommodation**: Book a hotel close to the conference venue or as recommended by the organizers.

## 3. Conference Materials
- **Presentation Materials**: Ensure your slides, posters, or other presentation materials are ready and backed up on multiple devices.
- **Conference Schedule**: Review the schedule and note down sessions you are interested in or networking opportunities.
- **Business Cards**: Prepare and carry business cards for networking.

## 4. Clothing and Essentials
- **Weather-Appropriate Clothing**: Check the weather forecast and pack accordingly. Germany in September can be mild but chilly in the evenings, so layer up.
- **Electronic Devices**: Don’t forget your laptop, chargers, and any necessary adapters (Germany uses Type F plugs).
- **Miscellaneous**: Consider packing snacks, personal medication, and any other personal essentials.

## 5. Communication and Connectivity
- **Mobile Plan**: Check if your mobile plan supports international roaming, or buy a local SIM card upon arrival.
- **Wi-Fi Access**: Confirm that your accommodation and conference venue provide Wi-Fi access.

## 6. Financial and Insurance
- **Currency Exchange**: Carry some cash in Euros for small expenses, though cards are widely accepted.
- **Travel Insurance**: Make sure you have travel insurance covering health and travel-related incidents.
