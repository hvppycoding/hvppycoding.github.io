In this article, I will provide a guide on building OpenROAD from its source code.

## 0. Install docker

[Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## 1. Build Using Docker from sources

The following instructions build the docker image with CentOS 7 as the base OS:

**WARNING:** Execute these instructions on **your* local computer. This will generate a Docker image named `openroad/flow-centos7-builder`.
{: .notice--warning}  

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts
./build_openroad.sh 
```

## 2. Verify Installation

The binaries are only available from inside a Docker container. Here is an example of starting a container from the created Docker image.  

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
  -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
  -v $(pwd)/flow:/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow openroad/flow-centos7-builder
```

Then, inside docker:

```sh
source ./env.sh
yosys -help
openroad -help
cd flow
make
exit
```

**WARNING:** An error related to `eqy` has been identified. Please refer to the [issue](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/issues/4092). To address this, I have commented out `EQUIVALENCE_CHECK = 1` in the file `flow/designs/nangate45/gcd/config.mk`.
{: .notice--warning}  

## 3. Enable GUI support

To use the GUI feature you will need to start the docker with the following command,

For Ubuntu/Centos/Debian OS users:

```sh
docker run --rm -it \
           -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) \
           -v $(pwd)/flow:/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow \
           -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} \
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
           -v ${HOME}/.Xauthority:/.Xauthority \
           --network host \
           --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
           openroad/flow-centos7-builder
```

Then, inside docker:

```sh
source ./env.sh
openroad -gui
```

You can open the result by activating `[File] - [Open DB]` menu. If you have run an example, the result DB can be found in the `flow/results` directory.
